    "EnglishAttack is an exciting project; it helps people to learn the English language using an <strong>interactive</strong> approach. It’s an ongoing project that never stops growing and evolving. I’ve joined the project for roughly three months when the client wanted to do a design revamp for the whole website. I’ve helped with the <strong>front-end structure</strong> and some, hopefully, useful <strong>ideas</strong>. Once the front-end base was in place, my colleagues continued the work without me, and I’ve moved to my next adventure. "
