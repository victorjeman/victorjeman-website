    "EnglishAttack is an exciting project; it helps people to learn the English language using an interactive approach. It’s an ongoing project that never stops growing and evolving. I’ve joined the project for roughly three months when the client wanted to do a design revamp for the whole website. I’ve helped with the front-end structure and some, hopefully, useful ideas. Once the front-end base was in place, my colleagues continued the work without me, and I’ve moved to my next adventure. "
