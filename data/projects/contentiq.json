    "This project is quite <strong>big</strong>. It’s composed of multiple sub-projects that are working together through a complex <strong>REST API</strong>. At the moment, 20 people from ASSIST form five different teams(QA, DevOps, and three development teams) that work tirelessly to make this project a <strong>success</strong>.  These teams are collaborating with people from the US and Israel.",
    "I have the pleasure of being the <strong>team leader</strong> for such a sub-project, and I have to tell you that the fun never stops. Sometimes I would gladly renounce such “fun,” but to be honest, I <strong>love</strong> it most of the time. And you have to love your work if you don’t want to go insane. The project is complex, and it requires constant tight <strong>collaboration</strong> with different teams, which sometimes is a challenge, but it’s all worth it at the end of the day.",
    "The project brings me <strong>joy</strong> and pushes me to overcome my limits. Plus, I interact with fantastic people with different views about life, and I’m <strong>learning</strong> a lot from them. "
