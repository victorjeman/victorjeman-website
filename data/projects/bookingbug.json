    "A remarkable project that motivated me to learn so many technical and <strong>soft skills</strong>. Our client was from the UK, and the collaboration was very fruitful. They had different development teams there, and we learned and grew together. I had the pleasure of being a <strong>team lead</strong> for a group of seven developers and one QA from ASSIST. It was a poetic combination, we worked together as a family, and we learned many great things.",
    "I was responsible for <strong>guiding</strong> and helping my colleagues so that we could achieve together the set objectives. I've learned a lot about <strong>patience</strong> and the importance of being understanding.",
    "We were <strong>responsabile</strong> for building custom journeys for differnt clients. If you are curious to find more about the company you can check their website <a href=\"https://www.jrni.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><strong>jrni</strong></a>."
