    "I've worked with Victor for a number of years on a number of projects. Victor is a knowledgable front end developer and diligent member of the team, and would consistently step outside of his role to help us achieve our companies business objectives. He consistently makes pragmatic decisions and understands the balance between making the best technology and business decisions.",
    "Victor and his team was always well run, organised and always consistently improving their skills. Iâ€™d gladly work with him and his team again."
