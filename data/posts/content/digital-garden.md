**TL; DR;**

- Understand your fear. Be honest, don’t bullshit yourself. No one is listening; you can be real for a moment.
- Divide and conquer. Don’t try to fix it all at once. Chop at it, little by little.
- Tell a friend or a mentor about it.
- Implement practical exercises that will get you used to your fear.
- It’s not just you; everyone is scared; they could be a little better than you at hiding it, that’s all.
- Once you’ve trained a little, do the thing that scares you, do it and fail. The sooner you fail, the sooner you’ll learn something and do it again much better.

<h2 id="section-1">The fear is real, so must be you</h2>

I recently managed to kick start my website(dude, it’s old news, get over it).
I managed to finish the initial step while I was on vacation, and I've been quite happy about it. Next week though, I’m going back to work, it’s about time. Thinking about this is raising all kinds of doubts in my mind.

- Will I have the time to continue?
- Will I have the willpower to be consistent?
- **Is it worth it?**
