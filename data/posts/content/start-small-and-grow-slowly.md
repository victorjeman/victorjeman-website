Would you like to help kids learning how to code?
I know I would love to become **a** great **mentor**, not for one or two but **for thousands of people**.
I know, it’s kind of a big deal.

Still, when the goal is ambitious, **it’s easy to be discouraged** by all the blockers that we encounter.

I have what to teach others; at least, I think I do, but I need to learn a fun and exciting way to deliver it.

Long story short, after writing the article about “sell your knowledge and experience, not your time.” someone approached me on Linkedin.

> Would you like to help kids learning how to code?

Without hesitation, I said **yes**!

I didn’t give my brain a chance to find all the suitable excuses to demonstrate why I shouldn’t do it.

I just had the first lesson yesterday with five kids trying to learn to program in <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">scratch.mit.edu</a>. It’s a wonderfully simple and powerful platform that allows you to **program your own interactive stories and games**.

The fantastic thing for me is all the soft skills I can polish collaborating with kids. I can’t wait for the next lesson. I'm sure that I will learn a lot from this experience!

If you are a developer or an IT student from Romania and are interested in being a mentor for kids, checkout the following Facebook event

**Lesson for me**: Don’t worry about making videos on youtube that will help thousands of people. See first if I can help a child to learn something new. Slowly but surely!

**General Lesson**: Start small, fail if needed but not necessarily, and improve the core areas for your long-term goal. Small steps, steady steps.
