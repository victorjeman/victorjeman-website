Welcome to a “hello world” type of post, hate it, love it, do what you feel, do what makes you happy.

I’m Jeman, Victor Jeman. I was born in Moldova (practically mother Russia) and raised by Romania’s wolves. I’ve moved to Romania when I was 15; it was a fun process. My superpowers are laziness and **daydreaming**. I’m writing this while drinking a glass of wine called “Castel Huniade,” you should try it.

I’m actively fighting one of my superpowers by writing this article, yes, **laziness**. Being lazy is good in small doses; I hear smart people are usually lazy, so that goes well for me. Still, when laziness it’s crawling all over you, it’s a sign that you should move your ass and do something, something creative if possible. This website is my “**something creative**” thing.

> So what's this all about, you will say?

I’m glad you asked!
I want that feeling, that feeling that you have when you help others. The feeling you get when you are a part of something bigger than yourself. **I want to be useful to you!**

> How exactly will I be useful?

In my daily work, I’m a programmer and a team leader. I’m surrounded by excellent programmers and very cool people, which means I have an **infinite source of inspiration**. I will write, call them programming stories, and hopefully, you can learn something from them.

<div style="text-align:center">
  <a class="c-post-content-anchor" href="/stories" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
    <span class="c-post-content-anchor__stripe c-post-content-anchor__stripe--1"></span>
    <span class="c-post-content-anchor__text">Stories!</span>
    <span class="c-post-content-anchor__stripe c-post-content-anchor__stripe--2"></span>
  </a>
</div>

Besides stories, I will provide some cool homework ideas. Yes, you heard me right, homework. Think of this as your laboratory where you get the chance to work towards a specific goal. I will provide the requirements, a cool design, tips, and useful links from where you can learn. All you have to do is **get your hands dirty** by writing some code and be proud of your accomplishments.

<div style="text-align:center">
  <a class="c-post-content-anchor" href="/labs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
    <span class="c-post-content-anchor__stripe c-post-content-anchor__stripe--1"></span>
    <span class="c-post-content-anchor__text">Labs!</span>
    <span class="c-post-content-anchor__stripe c-post-content-anchor__stripe--2"></span>
  </a>
</div>

**Stick around**, see how this venture goes. I will enable some kind of comments so you can point fingers at me if I fuck this up and don’t add anything new. Maybe I should create a couple of posts in advance, just to be sure.

**Stay safe, and do more of what makes you happy!**
