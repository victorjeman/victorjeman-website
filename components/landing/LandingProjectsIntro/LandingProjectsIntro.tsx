            {new Date().getFullYear() - 2012} years ago as a freelancer by stitching together static
            websites, then I got a full time job and started working with all kinds of fancy
            libraries and frameworks.

            At the moment I could say Iâ€™m still working with static websites, though the
            technologies and the whole process behind them are different and extraordinary. It's
            interesting though how some things stay classy and powerful through time.

          <p className="c-landing-projects-intro__text">
            I'm flexible when it comes to technical requirements and not only. I can easily switch
            my trajectory if the situation requires it, and it's beneficial for the project. I will
            learn something even if it's not directly required. I will do it anyway if I feel it
            will help the project.

          <p className="c-landing-projects-intro__text">
            For a project, I've even done automated tests with webdriver.io and created a container
            for those tests after learning the basics in a couple of days. I had to? Not really, but
            it was nice that I can help.
            <br />
            <br /> <strong>P.S.</strong> Initially, the docker setup was somewhat embarrassing to
            look at, but it's working alright now.
